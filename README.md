UPDATED! 
- (we have to have more terminal.printlns in server for when registration of nodes are received and when heartbeats are received - Kmla wants to do this.) DONE!

- we have to comment each of our own code and make it pretty

- (we have to account for the name not being found) DONE!

- (we have to work out how to ensure all the workers have been stopped (I will email steffan and ask if we should even be 
creating multiple workers or if he wants us to create one and he'll open it on multiple different computers)) DONE!

- we have to work out why the line number is wrong on the names


REPORT (UPDATED!)
===============
To make it easy on me, kmleh, would you guys please upload your sections in the report as you would a class of code? So call it after your name, and paste in your documentation into where code would usually go. THANKS.
Headings:

1. Introduction

2. High Level Description of main classes - (Worker node, server, client, register, worker packet, heartbeat, result packet)  

3. Implementation of program - Small finicky things you need to know about our program / additional classes needed for the flow of things in the program (WRITE IN A DIFFERENT WAY YOU WOULD WRITE HIGH LEVEL): fileinfocontent, heartbeat tracker, stop work

4. Reflections & Conclusion (include advantages & disadvantages etc)


Write your section and submit to kmlaaaa. Please include snippets of PSEUDO CODE :D

- David: Introduction / 95% of server (High level description) / Heartbeat (High level description) / Reflection & Conclusion

- Shane: 5% of server / Worker node (High level description)/  Worker packet(High level description) / Heartbeat tracker (Implementation level)

- Kmla: Client (High level description) / FileInfoContent (Implementation level) / Register (High level description) / Result Packet (High level description) / Stop Work (Implementation level)
