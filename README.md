=================
- we have to have more terminal.printlns in server for when registration of nodes are received and when heartbeats are received

- we have to comment code and make it pretty

- we have to account for the name not being found

- we have to work out how to ensure all the workers have been stopped (I will email steffan and ask if we should even be 
creating multiple workers or if he wants us to create one and he'll open it on multiple different computers)

- we have to work out why the line number is wrong on the names


-- REPORT -- 
We will all write an individual section on this section once all code is perfect, include pseudo code, and send to me .
- David: Most aspects of server / Heartbeat / 
- Shane: Some aspects of server / Worker node /  Worker packet / Heartbeat tracker
- Kmla: Client / FileInfoContent / Register / Result Packet / Stop Work
