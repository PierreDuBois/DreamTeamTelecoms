=================
- we have to have more terminal.printlns in server for when registration of nodes are received and when heartbeats are received - Kmla wants to do this.

- we have to comment each of our own code and make it pretty

- we have to account for the name not being found

- we have to work out how to ensure all the workers have been stopped (I will email steffan and ask if we should even be 
creating multiple workers or if he wants us to create one and he'll open it on multiple different computers)

- we have to work out why the line number is wrong on the names


REPORT
===============
Headings:

1. Introduction

2. High Level Description of main classes - (Worker node, server, client, register, worker packet, heartbeat, result packet)  

3. Implementation of program - Small finicky things you need to know about our program (WRITE IN A DIFFERENT WAY YOU WOULD WRITE HIGH LEVEL): fileinfocontent, heartbeat tracker, stop work

4. Reflections & Conclusion (include advantages & disadvantages etc)


We will all write an individual section on this section once all code is perfect, include pseudo code, and send to me .
- David: Introduction / 95% of server (High level description) / Heartbeat (High level description) / Reflection & Conclusion
